While I was designing the mock up web page I based its design on Nintendoâ€™s official Amiibo Web site and mixed it with 
elements from blogs to make it more news focused to allow users to find new information as quickly as possible. This is my 
main focused since the Nintendo pages dos not have the most up to date information and has a fairly poor layout for new 
information.
